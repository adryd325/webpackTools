# webpackTools

A userscript for reverse engineering, debugging, and modifying sites using webpack.

## Installing
The runtime with an example config for twitter can be installed from https://moonlight-mod.github.io/webpackTools/webpackTools.user.js

## Usage

An example config exists in the userscript with all fields documented.

### Spacepack Everywhere

By enabling `spacepackEverywhere` in your config, spacepack will automatically be injected into any webpack instances found. 

spacepack will then be accessible from `window.spacepack` or window.spacepack_<webpackChunkObject> if there happens to be multiple webpack instances

This version of spacepack is *slightly* different to the one in moonlight, however usage should be nearly the same. `__namedRequire`, `chunkObject`, and `name` are new to this version however.

TODO: Either write own docs about spacepack or link to moonlight docs

### Full patching support

Patching and module injection are explained in the [Moonlight docs](https://moonlight-mod.github.io/docs/ext-dev/webpack). 

Patches are nearly identical to Moonlight, minus the typing.

Module injection is different to Moonlight. Anything handled by dependencies in Moonlight is handled with needs in wpTools. Needs can be a string or regexp match for a module, or an object with a defined `moduleId`. Modules you define will only be injected after all their needs are met.

```js
{
  name: "needsDemo", 
  // Set of strings, or regexes of modules that need to be loaded before injecting this one. can also be 
  // `{moduleId: <moduleId>}` if depending on other injected or named modules.
  needs: new Set(
    "stringMatch!",
    /regexpMatch/,
    {moduleId: "spacepack"} // Match by module id.
  ), 
  entry: true,
  run: function (module, exports, webpackRequire) {
    webpackRequire("spacepack")
    console.log("Module injection works!!!");
  },
},
```

## Updating
To update to the latest webpackTools runtime while maintaining your existing config, edit your userscript and replace the string after `const runtime = ` with https://moonlight-mod.github.io/webpackTools/webpackTools.runtime.json. 

## Caveats

Some sites, namely Discord, will start multiple webpack runtimes running on the same webpackChunk object. Duplicate runtimes can be found in `window.wpTools.runtimes`. Injected modules will run multiple times, one for each runtime.

Some sites don't expose their export cache, making `spacepack.findModulesByExports` unusable and `spacepack.exports` undefined.

In Firefox, clicking on links in stacktraces from functions with `//# sourceURL=` will send you to a blank page. It's best to just open them from the sources tab

Some sites have impropper scoping and `patchAll` will cause the page to fail to load. Patching will still work in isolation as long as you dont patch a module using impropper scoping

A lot of this is based on research by [Mary](https://github.com/mstrodl) and [Cynthia](https://github.com/cynosphere) (HH3), and [Twilight Sparkle](https://github.com/twilight-sparkle-irl/) (webcrack, crispr, Endpwn)

## Terminology

We use our own names for a lot of things as we feel they make more sense, however here's some mappings to webpack's "official" namings and it can be slightly confusing

 - modules, or module cache: `moduleFactories`  
 - exports, or export cache: `moduleCache`  
 - chunkObject (typically webpackJsonp or webpackChunk): `chunkCallback` or `chunkLoadingGlobal`
